President Donald Trump and his rabid supporters,left

"Although Twitter and Facebook have been cracking down on some far-right users, extremists have found other ways to communicate",left
A Federal Domestic Terrorism Law Could Threaten Civil Rights Groups Like BLM,left
"In the wake of the insurrection on the nation’s Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden did not hesitate to refer to the far-right extremists who perpetrated the attack as domestic terrorists. ""They weren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists,” Biden said. “It's that basic. It's that simple.”",left
"Patel said that he doubted a domestic terrorism law would push the FBI to focus on right-wing extremism. “That seems, to me, not a particularly compelling argument — because that's just saying it's a failure of will, as opposed to a failure of the law,” Patel said. “And I believe that our lack of action for many, many years on the threat of far-right violence has been a lack of political will.”",left
"Can America still promote democracy? Yes, and it should start with Ukraine",left
"But those foreign policy failures pale in comparison to the damage done by Trump in the four years that preceded last Wednesday's violence. The real estate mogul has often dressed down allies with the tone of an angry mafia boss, and he has either cheered on or turned a blind eye to the nefarious actions of our enemies -- neither of which has helped US global standing.",left
"So, after four years of Trump, the US stands weakened on every front, undoubtedly to the delight of all its adversaries and to the dismay of all its allies. Last Wednesday's violence added an exclamation point to the Trump era's message to the world: The US no longer lives by the values it has preached for decades.",left
"Since Trump was impeached for attempting to lure Ukraine into opening an investigation that would tarnish the reputation of Biden, his domestic political rival, Ukraine has been in crisis.",left
"Even on Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, Trump has contradicted US policy. ",left
Trump Ignites a War Within the Church,left
"Biden has previously said that number is unacceptable and, on Friday, reiterated his pledge of 100 million shots within the first 100 days of his presidency. That would represent an increase from the current pace ― although, critically, the pace would have to quicken even more for the country to have any hope of achieving herd immunity some time in the summer.",left
"Although Biden didn’t mention those reports specifically, on Friday he suggested that states ― and the public ― could expect better from his administration. “You have my word, we will manage the hell out of this operation,” Biden said.",left
"The Biden plan also envisions new mass vaccination sites and mobile clinics ― with the federal government assisting state and local governments or, when necessary, operating clinics directly through the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Within the first month of his administration, Biden said, FEMA would be operating 100 mass vaccination centers around the country.",left
"For that reason, success will depend not simply on the policies but the people enacting them ― starting with officials like Jeff Zients, whom Biden had already tapped to run the COVID-19 response, and Andy Slavitt, whom Biden on Friday named to a temporary post on the administration’s COVID-19 team.",left
"On Monday, Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency made its latest Big Tobacco-like move in the war on public health when it declined to raise air quality standards for fine particulate matter. The decision flies in the face of mounting scientific evidence that air pollution is worsening the pandemic — not just by exacerbating the severity of Covid-19 symptoms, but by transporting the virus at greater distances through the air.",left
"Public health experts have been recommending that the EPA further restrict air pollution for years. Specifically, they’ve recommended reducing fine particulates, tiny dust specks about one-thirtieth the size of a human hair that make up about 90 percent of all U.S. air pollution. These specks are well known for triggering asthma, heart problems and about 100,000 deaths a year in the U.S.",left
"Republicans are scared. As Congress moves forward with the second impeachment of President Donald Trump, some GOP members of the House have quietly admitted that they were worried that voting to impeach the president could put them and their families in danger.",left
"Now, Trump is singing the same tune about outsiders, but with a slightly different hook: baselessly claiming that Democrats, buoyed by voters of color, stole our election in the hopes of hijacking America.",left
"Trump’s mob of supporters, captured for the world to see as they climbed the “big beautiful walls” of the Capitol, may have been motivated to riot and violence by false claims of voter fraud and a stolen election. But this most recent lie is a culmination of all the other lies and fears this president has stoked over the past four years.",left
"It’s tempting to think of the storming of the US Capitol on Wednesday as toxic masculinity run amok: a mob of mostly white men, carrying guns and wearing animal skins, trying to overthrow democracy on behalf of a president who once bragged about his ability to grab women “by the pussy.”",left
"White women have been part of white supremacy in America since the very beginning, experts point out, dating back to their role in slavery. “They were at the table when the system was designed,” Stephanie Jones-Rogers, a history professor at UC Berkeley and author of the book They Were Her Property: White Women as Slave Owners in the American South, told Vox. “They were co-architects of the system.”",left
"The implication is clear: If we want the pandemic to end as fast as possible, we need to pump the brakes right now. And we don’t have to wait for the vaccines to slow the spread of the virus. We simply need to do what we’ve been doing all along to prevent infections, just much, much better. At an individual level, that means avoiding optional gatherings with other people — even grocery trips — whenever possible, or cutting them very short",left
"But a new poll by the Pew Research Center suggests that the events of the last few weeks — a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol, and then Trump was impeached for the second time in his presidency — are finally starting to weigh on Republican voters. The poll was conducted from January 8-12, so it was conducted entirely after the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.",left
Republican senators will be more likely to do so if Trump is a toxic figure with the public at large. And they’ll be even more likely to do so if large numbers of their own base view Trump’s insurrectionist behavior as unforgivable.,left
The Justice Department’s association of Black lawyers put out a statement on Friday calling on leadership to investigate the “clear disparity” in how the pro-Trump insurrectionists who attacked the US Capitol last week were treated compared to Black Lives Matter demonstrators last summer.,left
"The Justice Department under the Trump administration lacked racial and gender diversity in leadership posts and actively worked to roll back civil rights protections and scale back programs meant to hold police departments accountable for misconduct and abuses. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to reinvigorate the department’s civil rights work, and last week announced two longtime civil rights advocates as his nominees for top positions at the department",left
"Trump sold himself very effectively as an economic populist, boasting for years about the strength of the US economy under his leadership. But his tax overhaul cut taxes for the wealthy and for corporations; inequality reached new highs as billionaire wealth soared and investors made gains from the stock market while the poorest households hardly saw any improvements. Despite endorsing stimulus checks during the pandemic (checks bearing his name, in an election year), Trump has largely abandoned economic populism — and yet his base still follows him. It’s worth examining why.",left
"As Donald Trump nears the end of his term, he leaves behind an ambassadorial corps that is whiter than it’s been in more than 40 years. Only five of Trump’s 189 ambassadorial appointees were Black. No president since John F. Kennedy has appointed fewer Black ambassadors than Trump, according to research compiled by Carlton McLellan, a senior fellow at the Association of Black American Ambassadors.",left
"Trump did not create this problem, but his egregious lack of interest in addressing it has only heightened the concern for career staff, who plan to push Joe Biden’s incoming administration to make it a priority. Biden can diversify the department’s leadership and ambassador ranks, but fixing the Foreign Service requires addressing problems that extend back decades and have persisted through presidential administrations from both parties.  ",left
"Still, the effects of Trump’s abominable record on diversity could linger, making it more difficult for ambassadors to convincingly push foreign leaders to crack down on discrimination in their own countries. “If we mistreat marginalized [communities] or sideline minorities in this country, our message goes over like a lead balloon,” Charles Ray, a former ambassador to Zimbabwe and Cambodia, told me. ",left
"Biden has previously promised to extend the forbearance in the first days after his swearing-in. In a call with reporters on Thursday, administration officials said forbearance was still a priority for the president-elect, and that Biden would address the issue directly in the next phase of his recovery plan. They also reiterated Biden’s desire to make good on his promise to forgive up to $10,000 in student debt. Transition officials have expressed hope that the package will garner bipartisan support, so it can pass the Senate with 60 votes.",left
"Biden’s plan will give stimulus checks of up to $1,400 per individual or $2,800 per household. This amount, plus the $600 checks Americans received from the $900 billion stimulus package that President Trump signed last month, adds up to the $2,000-per-person promise Biden made while stumping for the Senate candidates in Georgia. But some progressive lawmakers, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), are calling on Biden to include a full $2,000 in his plan. Ocasio-Cortez accuses him of stopping short of his pledge: “$2,000 means $2,000;” she told the Washington Post, “$2,000 does not mean $1,400.”",left
"The Trump administration’s final attempt to sabotage the census is dead. On Friday, the Justice Department told a federal judge that the Census Bureau would not release data on the number of undocumented immigrants living in each state before Jan. 20. NPR’s Hansi Lo Wang first reported the DOJ’s filing. Donald Trump intended to use this data for the apportionment of congressional seats among states; his plan, if successful, would have stripped seats in the House of Representatives from states with large undocumented communities. Trump’s political appointees tried to rush out this data before the president’s term ends, but the task proved impossible. Joe Biden is certain to undo the directive, ensuring that congressional seats will be apportioned based on the entire population of each state—as required by the Constitution.",left
From Charlottesville to the Capitol: Trump Fueled Right-Wing Violence. It May Soon Get Even Worse,left
"Last week, as the smoke cleared from the shocking pro-Trump mob attack on the US Capitol, America's global reputation as a stable, strong democracy emerged badly damaged. Now, many are questioning whether it can ever regain the moral authority necessary to lead the world's democracies, fledgling or otherwise.",left
"But as for US foreign policy, once in office President-elect Joe Biden can move quickly down the list and cancel out the damaging foreign policies Trump has instituted, reversing the ""America first"" -- or, in some cases, ""Trump first"" -- attitude the current President has taken toward a host of global issues and hotspots.",left
"Trump has done damage to democracy's reputation globally in ways I never imagined I would see. President-elect Joe Biden is right to say it is ""fragile."" It is also precious, and effective. For now, it worked. Trump and the domestic terrorism he fomented were - in this moment - defeated. There turned out to be enduring values at the heart of even some of the most compromised American elected officials. That is not a global norm.",left
"Donald John Trump will be remembered as the only president in American history to be impeached on two separate occasions. He incited an insurrection that was in effect a frontal and physical assault on the constitutional order, the peaceful transfer of power, the vice president and the Congress itself. On top of an already shameful record, the events of January 6, 2021, will define Trump's legacy forever and stain the pages of American history.",left
"Under Trump, the GOP lost the House of Representatives in 2018 and the White House and the Senate in 2020. Even worse, the GOP may have lost its soul. It is now fractured between Trump supporters and those who want a clean break from him. While many House Republicans reportedly supported impeachment, only 10 courageous GOP members actually voted for it. If the Senate were to convict Trump and prohibit him from ever seeking high office again, many House Republicans would be most grateful and relieved. It's called ""hope yes, vote no.""",left
"The GOP representatives who voted in favor of impeachment represent geographically diverse areas. They rejected the procedural arguments of many of their Republican colleagues and directly addressed in their arguments the substance of what occurred last week. These members are to be commended for their exemplary leadership. Explaining his vote in support of impeachment, Don Newhouse (R-Washington), with simple eloquence, said it best: ""I will not use process as an excuse. There is no excuse for President Trump's actions.""",left
The sheer velocity of Donald Trump's false and misleading statements -- along with the proliferation of disinformation on social media -- have demanded significant fact-checking to defend liberal democracy.,left
"For the last four years, fact-checkers have had their hands full keeping up with President Donald Trump's unprecedented level of dishonesty. While The Washington Post reported that Trump had delivered more than 22,000 false or misleading claims and as of Oct. 22, a new editorial highlights the president's most dangerous lies over the course of his presidency.",left
"In fact, some of the disgraced president's notable claims likely helped to shape his presidency and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. The publication reports that Trump's remarks insisting the coronavirus was ""under control."" From the beginning of the pandemic up to the grim point where the country is now, Trump has repeatedly claimed that his administration has had the coronavirus ""under control.""",left
"Trump's ""most depressing lie"" centers on his latest conspiracy about the election being stolen from him. In the months leading up to the presidential election, Trump repeatedly insisted if he lost the election, it would be because Democrats cheated.",left
That claim set the tone for Trump to justify losing the election which subsequently led to a barrage of other lies and conspiracy theories that inundated social media platforms with misinformation. That same lie also spawned the challenges lawmakers put in motion to contest the Electoral College certification that was interrupted by angry Trump supporters storming the U.S. Capitol.,left
"The fact that Trump appears to be meeting with someone still pursuing the idea that the election result was illegitimate and perhaps could still be overturned shows the danger of leaving him in office, even if he has released statements that seem to acknowledge Biden will be president by next week.",left
"""It won't happen, of course, but still a gentle reminder that the president is still completely batshit insane, heavily invested in his own conspiracy theories, and is going to spend his remaining hours listening to sycophants tell him how to burn various institutions down,"" said national security commentator Matt Tait on Twitter. ""Protip for impeachment managers is to print this out in really big and point at it with a telescopic pointer to remind senators that *one week* after the failed Capitol attack the president was having meetings with sycophants to talk about the 'insurrection act' and 'marshal law.'""",left
"Altogether, the visible information looks like a continuation of the election disinformation and false conspiracy theories that have been repeatedly debunked and that flopped in court. It also seems that Lindell has suggestions for how Trump should respond to this information using his remaining days as president, though the outline of the scheme is unclear. How seriously Lindell is taking these ideas is also not certain, though he has been a fervent and erratic defender of the president, and Trump's reception to the ideas is unknown.",left
"Donald Trump's attempted coup against our government was predictable. He had it all planned out. He would incite thousands of supporters to attack the Capitol, disrupt the proceedings of the Senate and find a way to maintain his grip on power. He knew full well that his violent insurrectionists had blood on their minds and that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence were in harm's way. He knew there was a chance that both Pelosi and Pence could be kidnapped or murdered. He did not care one whit. He was partying and celebrating as the attackers formed and began their deadly march. He was inciting an insurrection against the United States for his own personal gain. Democracy and human life were of no concern to him.",left
"But his efforts failed. The Senate was not overtaken. Joe Biden was certified as the next president. Pelosi and Pence were both safe. The attackers are being hunted down one by one and arrested. Trump has now been impeached for the second time, with 10 Republican members of Congress joining with every Democrat. Pence apparently contemplated the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment (although he has now said he will not do so). The majority of Americans believe that Trump should be removed from office immediately for his treasonous behavior.",left
"After last week's insurrection attempt, Trump is now trying to act as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. What is the big deal if some looters swarmed through the Capitol? As he has always done, Trump relies on lies, denials, conspiracy theories and fake bravado to skirt through life and through his presidency. But rhetoric and actions are observable truth. And Trump's clear incitement of insurrection means he is a traitor. It means he disavowed the will of the people and the rule of law. It means his personal gain is more important than the Constitution and his oath of office.",left
"What should now be clear to everyone is that Donald Trump does not love democracy or our country. He is an authoritarian. He wants absolute authority and control over people. He loves adulation. He is a greedy opportunist. He is a master of demagoguery. He is corrupt and criminal. He is a traitor of the highest order. He was virtually the worst possible person to become president because everything about him is antithetical to our nation's principles and ideals. Being president is so much more than being rich. Personal character, love of democracy and love of country are far more compelling attributes.",left
"We should not be surprised that Trump's sadism and violence boiled over in response to his humiliating election defeat. He has been hell-bent on hanging onto power at any cost. He has been willing to throw anyone and anything under the bus to ensure his self-preservation and his survival. So a violent insurrection in the sacred halls of the Capitol was the perfect plan in his mind. A few deaths would be palatable, even entirely acceptable, if it meant he could remain in power.",left
"Trump is a cataclysmic problem that will be solved soon. He will be booted out, or simply leave. Social media platforms have banned him. Companies are halting their financial contributions to his party and his supporters. The PGA has pulled its 2022 championship tournament from his New Jersey golf course. More and more Americans are rejecting him by the day. His mantra as a traitor is beginning to take hold. Ultimately, it will be set in stone.",left
"Millions of supporters followed Trump for four years as if he were the pied piper. They did not realize or understand that he is a con man who thrives on hoodwinking and exploiting others. He lies every time he opens his mouth, and uses conspiracy theories and fear-mongering to seduce the allegiance of citizens who believe in him for various largely irrational reasons. Trump is no public servant, no brilliant businessman, no rich savant and no political leader. He is a fraud, a failure and a coward who ran for president in the first place to enhance his brand and make money off the public. Once in office, he became enthralled with power, adulation and grifting. He realized that being an authoritarian leader would allow him to express his sadistic and cruel tendencies — and that being a dictator would allow his racist and xenophobic and misogynistic impulses to run wild, without oversight or accountability. In the end, Trump decided that he wanted to remain in office so that he could establish an endless regime of Trumpism — all in his psychopathic image.",left
"Americans should have realized back in 2016 that Trump was a bad actor who had nefarious and cruel intentions. He did not want to protect and serve the people. The oath of office was a bunch of isolated words that had no meaning to him. It was all a big lie and a big con from the beginning. Trump believed he could pull it off because he had spent his entire life promulgating a kind of alternate universe, with the help of enablers and a host of lawyers.",left
"Trump's lies, conspiracy theories, magical thinking and corruption rapidly became normalized in our country, such that millions of Americans were radicalized. Fantasy and blather became more important than truth. Trump's alternate universe seemed to replace the real one. Our Constitution and the rule of law were corrupted. Our democracy was threatened. A psychopath was threatening democracy, and the media pretended not to notice. The opinions of mental health experts were rejected.",left
"Ultimately, the judicial system and our Constitution stood tall throughout this presidency. Elected Republican officials did not. They either drank the Kool-aid or saw loyalty to Trump as a vehicle for personal political advancement. Either way, the Republican Party has been complicit and anti-democratic. Some of its members, perhaps most of them, want to carry on the mantle of Trumpism despite its malicious and destructive impact on our democracy. They will face their reckoning in due time.",left
"Following complaints from Senators and employees, Facebook on Saturday said it was temporarily halting ads for gun accessories and military gear in the US through next week’s inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden",left
"While Facebook already prohibited advertisements for guns, ammunition and weapon enhancements like silencers, the company has still allowed ads for accessories including holsters and attachable flashlights and laser sights. Facebook users and employees noticed an uptick in ads for these products and military gear, including armored vests, on their newsfeeds in the days following a riot at the Capitol that left five people dead.",left
"Ads for tactical gear were also being shown to people who followed right-wing extremist pages or groups on the social network. Research from the Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit industry watchdog group, showed that a Facebook account set up by the organization to follow pages belonging to militant and white nationalist organizations on Facebook was regularly served ads for military gear in between posts casting doubt on the presidential election and others praising the assault on the US Capitol.",left
"Fearing a repeat of the deadly Capitol siege by pro-Trump mobs, governors across the country are taking unprecedented security measures to protect their state capitols from violent attacks ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration",left
A close look at those executed over the last six months shows that the federal death penalty is not reserved for the “worst of the worst” as some of its proponents contend. Instead it targets the most disadvantaged and disabled of those charged with capital crimes.,left
That is just one of the reasons why President-Elect Joe Biden should take decisive steps to end the federal death penalty and lead a campaign for nationwide abolition of capital punishment.,left
"Wrong! By Monday morning, Fox News had all but moved on from the story of the Capitol riot, so eager was the network to get back to yelling about the suppressive left. Consigning the Capitol story to a series of passing references, for three hours Fox & Friends made a passionate case for the right of extremely online MAGA propagandists to be able to harass, incite, and misinform people free from any and all consequences.",left
"No sentient observer should be surprised that Fox News has chosen to severely downplay the Capitol riot in order to instead spend hours whining about cancel culture. Choosing to miss the point in favor of another, much dumber point is what Fox News does. Whether reporting hysterically on a series of ginned-up nonscandals involving the Bidens and the Clintons in order to deflect attention away from the scandals engulfing the Trump administration; reporting breathlessly on the northward advance of a purportedly fearsome migrant caravan in the weeks preceding the 2018 midterm elections; pretending that “antifa” is a comprehensive and organized terror organization bent on burning America’s cities; or crying that Twitter plunged us all into some Orwellian thoughtcrime dystopia by deciding to ban the world’s biggest asshole from using its website after he riled up a deadly mob, Fox News has spent Trump’s entire presidency working tirelessly to make him look good by making the left look bad.",left
"As one example, Trump ally Ronna McDaniel—who retained her position last week as chairwoman of the Republican National Committee—has given typical statements saying “our country desperately needs to heal and unify” and that “the peaceful transition of power is one of our nation’s founding principles and is necessary for our country to move forward.” But nowhere in these statements did McDaniel acknowledge that Biden won the election by 7 million votes, winning the same number of Electoral College votes as Trump did in what he has described as his 2016 “landslide” victory. On Monday, I emailed the RNC to ask if McDaniel would affirm that Joe Biden won the election, with 81 million votes, and that there was no fraud or unlawful irregularities that affected the outcome.",left

"“I think giving the government the ability to prevent people from flying on the basis of officers’ hunches, or on the basis of evidence that isn’t tested in court, is an invitation to unfairness and abuse,” said Jameel Jaffer, a civil liberties attorney and director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “In my view, the government’s terrorism blacklists are a cautionary tale, not a promising model.”",left
"Yet I have come to realize that despite the scenes at the Capitol and all the violence that has broken out in this past year, with Trump supporting white nationalist militias, many Americans still truly believe that the kind of violence experienced by the “other” will somehow escape them. American exceptionalism, even when it’s falling apart right in front of your eyes, somehow remains prevalent.",left
"This exceptionalism, which allows many Americans to convince themselves that national breakdown takes place in foreign lands only, will undoubtedly have grave consequences. If it continues, Americans will not be prepared to deal with the inevitable rise and power of fascism. As someone who saw firsthand what ignoring nationalism does to a people and a country and the horrors it leads to, I implore those who choose to believe in American exceptionalism: Confront the horrors of this country’s past. Only then will you have a standing chance of beating the tide of rising fascism.",left
"The incoming Biden administration has said that it will “immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s cruel and senseless policies that separate parents from their children at our border.” The incoming administration has also pledged to convene a task force to reunite families who are still separated, though it has not offered specific details on that initiative. The American Civil Liberties Union, which has an active lawsuit against the federal government over its family separation policy, called for more. “The barbaric family separation practice was immoral and illegal,” Lee Gelernt, the organization’s lead attorney in that litigation, said in a statement Thursday. “The incoming administration must reunite the separated families in the United States, but we cannot stop there. These families deserve citizenship, resources, care, and a commitment that family separation will never happen again.”",left

All those things suddenly seem debased and of less value.""",left
"Regardless, the Trump era has left Europeans with little choice but to wait and see how much of a priority Biden places on reclaiming America's place on the world stage.

"As the attack on the US Capitol took place, it is not hard to imagine Putin looking on with glee. And it came after four years of Trump seeming to fulfill Putin's wish list, from publicly casting doubt on Putin's meddling in the 2016 US election (which was aimed at sweeping Trump into power), weakening NATO and perpetually attacking the US media to discrediting the American electoral process.",left
"Trump's administration has repeatedly attacked the rules-based multilateral system, on the basis that America has been shortchanged by unfair rules and a disproportionate burden of cost.

Democrats are again considering legislation to provide their wealthy blue state donors with billions by ending the cap on a tax deduction.,right
"As President-elect Joe Biden has released his $1.9 trillion Chinese coronavirus relief package that offers $1,400 stimulus checks to working and middle class Americans, rather than the $2,000 checks that President Trump had requested, Democrats are resurrecting their goal of providing tax breaks to the wealthiest of Americans, mostly concentrated in coastal blue states.",right
"Biden’s amnesty plan would need to garner support from a handful of 28 House Democrats who barely won their seats in the 2020 election and who will be up for reelection again in 2022.

"There’s no doubt that the virus came from China; the main question is whether or not it was from the wild, or from a laboratory, specifically, the Wuhan Institute of Virology. As this author noted in April, leading Republicans, including Sens. Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley, were even then pushing for a full investigation of the virus’s origins. Not surprisingly, the Chinese have stonewalled. As Dr. Anthony Fauci said on January 7, looking back at the beginning of the virus crisis, “Some things were known by the Chinese and they weren’t very transparent about it.” ",right

The Biden announcement Thursday of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package is a further reminder of how deep our troubles are — both in health and in economic terms. The various conflict-of-interest stories surrounding a number of Biden nominees is a further reminder that the issue of Democratic Party corruption will not go away.,right

"In addition, the president brought relative peace to the Middle East. He virtually destroyed ISIS and helped achieve remarkable peace agreements that will lead to diplomatic relations between four Muslim nations and Israel — an extraordinary accomplishment.",right
"Trump stood up to China, resetting the terms of relations between our countries. He understands that China is a growing threat to America — economically, morally and militarily.

"Perhaps if Joe Biden had not spent two years muscling up to Trump, with threats like ""I’d smack him in the mouth"" and ""I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him,"" Biden’s pitch for civility might be more palatable.",right
"Not that Democrats mind, of course. They never had any interest in the conciliatory version of Joe Biden. Appeals to unity won't, in the end, make them more powerful. With Trump leaving, Democrats are going to need a new enemy to hate, because hate is what holds their party together. Unfortunately for you, they've now decided that enemy is the entire Republican Party and all of its voters, roughly half the country.",right
"However, Biden was soon on TV comparing sitting U.S. senators to Nazis.

"On the campaign trail, Biden pledged to end the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) that keep migrants in Mexico as their hearings play out.

I find few things more tedious than a progressive trying to pick a fight over an article of mine through 5,000 mentions on Twitter.

When he died 20 years later, historians were ranking him as one of America’s great presidents, a standing he holds today.",right
"Few seem willing to admit it, but mass immigration appears to be killing democracy in the United States. Two-party democracy withstood the unprecedented mass immigration of the 1870-to-1914 period because the European immigrants tended, for one reason or another, to vote for both parties.

"President-elect Joe Biden proposed increasing the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $15 an hour as part of his coronavirus relief package announced Thursday night. Such a dramatic increase would exacerbate the devastating impact economic lockdowns are having on small businesses, while doing great harm to 10.7 million Americans who are unemployed.",right
"Biden proposes adding another $190 billion in aid for minority businesses. But if small businesses are already on the cusp of failure and need help just to pay their employees, why impose a big wage increase that makes doing so more difficult?",right
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when President Trump took office in January 2017 the average hourly wage for American workers was $26. It increased to $28.69 by March 2020. Since April, it has never dropped below $29.32 and currently sits at $29.81. That a 15% increase since 2017 and over 4% in just the last nine months.",right
The left complains that low-wage employees are forced to take advantage of government welfare programs to get by. But increasing the minimum wage to the point where it kills small businesses only increases the need for government assistance.,right
"People with a job and the potential to increase their earnings burden our welfare system far less than those without a job. Is it really better throw people out of work forcing them to rely entirely on welfare? For job seekers, it’s hard to imagine a worse time to raise the minimum wage.",right
"The story of how Biden went from being a much-mocked afterthought, liked by some but respected by nobody, to becoming the single most powerful man in the world at the age of 78 is a remarkable one. Someday, when the mania recedes and we can all agree to stop lying for a moment, it will be told.",right
"On Saturday, it was reported that Victoria recorded a whopping zero new locally acquired cases for three consecutive days, and 40 active cases in the entire state.

"All who hope their children and grandchildren will enjoy the same freedom they held growing up must heed the warning signs. What we’re witnessing, in real-time, is the dangerous normalization of a dystopian concept of “freedom” in which government dominates your life “for your own good.” Those who not only succumb to but laud such government restrictions for the mythical “greater good” betray those who sacrificed to preserve our God-given freedoms and worsen the odds that future generations can right the ship.",right
"Along with mistaking jokes for misinformation, Acosta likewise struggled to distinguish poetry and policy when discussing immigration. During a press briefing, he began reading the text of the poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, badgering Stephen Miller about differences between immigration policy and an engraving that has no bearing on the actual criteria for selecting who is granted legal entry into this country.",right
"The Wuhan virus warrants reminding the public where it came from even more so than others. As Rich Lowry points out in the National Review, China’s “government tried to suppress warnings about the new coronavirus and looked the other way, giving it the room to become a national and then a global crisis.” China therefore, “deserves to be connected to the virus it did more than its share to loose on the world, no matter what its foreign ministry or the sensitivity police say.”",right

"If you thought help for the coronavirus was on the way, think again. President-elect Joe Biden’s plan to provide economic relief is going to cause a lot of pain and waste a lot of money on people who do not need it.",right
"At a time when the nation’s entire problem is that so many people are out of work due to government restrictions on business, Biden wants to make it illegal to work for less than $15 per hour. That is the real-world effect of raising the minimum wage to that level, and it will be devastating for people living and working in poorer parts of the United States.",right
"It is a terrible idea right now to impose a massive labor cost increase on businesses that are already struggling to stay open. But even worse, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has recently estimated that such a move, despite giving a slight raise to as many as 17 million people, will destroy up to 3.7 million jobs overnight. So, if the goal is to harm those most affected by the coronavirus and reward those who got to keep their jobs, then Biden’s plan is just the thing.",right
"It is no mystery that Biden is out to pay back the union bosses who got him elected, whose union contracts are often based on a multiple of the minimum wage. But his proposal will destroy jobs and artificially hasten the processes of automation that is taking many low-skilled jobs off the table in these modern times. Biden seems unconcerned with the effect this will have on younger and less skilled workers.",right
Biden has famously complained about the need to restore the economy out of one side of his mouth and then promised out of the other side of his mouth to put the nation on lockdown if scientists tell him to. He seems to be bringing this lack of logic and consistency right into the early days of his administration.,right
"Over the last 12 months, government at various levels has deprived many people of their ability to make a living in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus. We urge Congress to pare back Biden’s plan. Please focus not on a broad and unnecessary, budget-busting stimulus but on aiding those who are suffering and actually need help.",right

"Hunter Biden makes Hugh and Tony Rodham, Hillary’s comically scummy brothers, look abstemious. And yet there Hunter was on ABC a few mornings ago, crying at the thought of what the amoral Donald Trump has done to “the presidency.” You see, Hunter was taught by his pop to “revere” the presidency, and it makes him really, really sad to see it fall into the hands of such a vulgarian. Poor Hunter also didn’t anticipate that Rudy Giuliani was going to play so dirty “with this ridiculous conspiracy idea.”",right
"The present massive wave of immigration that began in the 1970s, largely as a result of the extended family clause in the 1965 Kennedy immigration reform bill, has had remarkably different results. The new immigrants are voting overwhelmingly Democrat: Hispanics 2 to 1, Asians about 70 percent (all election figures from the Pew Research Center). The children of Asian immigrants voted 82 percent for Barack Obama in 2008. In addition, black Americans who used to vote Republican now vote 90 percent or more Democrat, as do black immigrants.",right
"California not long ago was a state Republicans could win. Two presidents, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, came from California and major offices such as governor were regularly won by Republicans. Today California is a permanently blue state, with its wealth of electoral votes. Its U.S. senators, governor, and most of its members of Congress are Democrats. Democrats have a supermajority in both houses of the Legislature and have changed the constitution so that party primaries have been banned in favor of “open” primaries in which Republicans are likely not to finish higher than third, thus not making the November ballot. In the last two U.S. Senate races, 2016 and 2018, voters were offered Democrat No. 1 and Democrat No. 2 as choices. Unsurprisingly, Democrats won both elections, and one of the winners, Kamala Harris, is now running for president.",right
"An excellent summary of election illegalities in the top six battleground states (does not include New Mexico), (“The Immaculate Deception”), was compiled by White House adviser Peter Navarro (working on his own, hence not an official White House document.) In broad brushstroke: (1) his report found significant voting “irregularities” whose extent dwarfed the thin Biden margins in the six battleground states; (2) mass/social media companies have refused to consider credible evidence of massive fraud; (3) GOP legislators wilted under intense political and media pressure; (4) state and federal courts — including the Supremes — failed to properly adjudicate lawsuits seeking to flip the results in contested states. ",right
"Experts compared records of voters as to name, address, and date of birth; this catches people who use middle initials or married names when they vote more than once, to hide duplication. Social Security death records were used to identify dead “voters.” The USPS address list was used to flag commercial addresses. In searching for absentee voters, they took care to exclude military voters and students, yet still found 19,000 out-of-state voters. They used motor vehicle registrations to flag non-citizen voters. In all, they turned up 130,000 unique instances of voter fraud.",right
"As this article goes to press, the Supreme Court has not acted on Team Trump’s petition for a hearing on Pennsylvania ballot issues, where there is no doubt that per Bush v. Gore the Court has jurisdiction to hear the case. With Bush v. Gore now apparently interred by the Supreme Court, future presidential contests will likely see vote fraud on a scale large enough to preclude resolution in a few weeks. Look as well for fraud in key House and Senate contests in 2022. Democrats did not anticipate Trump would have coattails, so they ignored down-ballot harvesting. The professionals now have two years to refine their suspicious voting practices to make them less detectible. Democrats will block efforts to reform voter laws. And as they got away with bypassing and outright ignoring laws this time, and the courts did not stop them, even if new laws pass they will be dead on arrival.",right
"Out of this mess surely there are more casualties to come. With a solid majority of Republicans convinced their candidate was cheated out of reelection, and a plurality of independents conceding that there was vote fraud, confidence in the integrity and fairness of America’s elections has taken yet another monster hit. That this will happen again is a virtual given. ",right
"It is frightening to face a virus and admit there is little we can do to stop it. The illusion of control is seductive. But giving in to it is not cost-free. Lockdowns wreak economic, social, and public health havoc: suicides and drug overdoses, mass unemployment, and supply-chain disruption that cause global famine and sharply higher deaths from tuberculosis and other diseases. Children are losing opportunities for educational and social development that may take years to remedy — or may prove permanent.",right
"The good news is that the virus is far less dangerous than originally thought, and even for the most at risk we have substantially improved treatment and knowledge, with vaccines close on the horizon as of this writing. The bad news is that, with even a normal seasonal rise in infections, politicians will be again tempted to do something, and that means ineffective and destructive lockdowns could be coming back. We need to stop them.",right

"Nancy Pelosi spent last year cheering on rioters who were a whole lot more destructive and threatening to good public order than the “mostly peaceful” crowd descending on the Capitol last Wednesday. “People will do what they do,” she said in response to mobs vandalizing and destroying public art over the summer. She fired off an angry letter to Trump complaining about “militarization” of security forces arrayed against rioters in Washington, getting especially incensed that some of those law enforcement officials deployed to stop Antifa from doing things like, for example, torching churches near the White House, were from “unidentified” agencies of the executive branch.",right
"And her riot-friendly rhetoric goes back a ways. “I just don’t even know why there aren’t uprisings all over the country, and maybe there will be when people realize that this is a policy that they defend,” she said in 2018 when the legacy corporate media ginned up the Fake News story about Trump putting illegal alien kids in cages.",right
The second problem is that people had already broken into the Capitol before Trump had finished his speech a 45-minute walk away. Pipe bombs found at RNC and DNC headquarters were laid before he had even begun speaking. That isn’t a timeline fitting the fake-news narrative that the rioters were a bunch of drones and Trumper minions marching in lockstep to his spoken word.,right
"Luckily, this “impeachment” won’t get any further this time than it did a year ago when Crazy Nancy first dropped it, Mando-style, in the House Chamber. But the stink will take a while to fade away, and if Pelosi thinks somehow her temper tantrum will make the plebes and hooples respect her authority any more than they did when a few of them broke into her office, threw her stuff around, and Bogarted her laptop, she’s off her meds.",right
"There is a major reason for this, of course, which is what else happened on Saturday. Namely, the GOP staged a rout of such proportions rarely seen in legislative races, all but wiping out the Democrat Party outside of majority-black districts.",right
"So much so that it’s well within reach for Republicans to control 27 of the 39 seats in the state Senate, one more than a supermajority. And it’s more than likely the GOP will have at least 68 of the 105 House seats, with at least a functional supermajority of 70 quite possible, when those runoff elections are completed. This, to go with every single down-ballot statewide race. Republican incumbents in the offices of lieutenant governor, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, and insurance commissioner all won reelection on Saturday, with the state’s GOP secretary of state facing a runoff he’ll easily win on November 16 (Republicans in that race carried 64 percent of the vote on Saturday).",right
"It’s a rolling disaster for the party that formerly governed Louisiana as a political fiefdom from Reconstruction until the late 1990s, and it could be the end of the Democrat Party as a major force in state politics. Few will miss them in a state left thoroughly broken by Edwards’ misrule and a tradition, built by his Democrat predecessors, of waste, corruption, overtaxation, and incompetence at the Capitol. If Rispone can finish the job the voters began on Saturday, the Bayou State might join the rest of America in the Trump revival.",right

"So what other forms of unity can we expect in a Biden administration? Well, you should ask John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. Fetterman isn't necessarily against the entire Bill of Rights, but he wants to be perfectly clear that going forward, the First Amendment does not apply to anything that offends him. That's why when Democrats claim the 2016 election was rigged by Russia and stolen by Vladimir Putin, that is protected speech, because John Fetterman believes it's true. ",right
"Not that Democrats mind, of course. They never had any interest in the conciliatory version of Joe Biden. Appeals to unity won't, in the end, make them more powerful. With Trump leaving, Democrats are going to need a new enemy to hate, because hate is what holds their party together. Unfortunately for you, they've now decided that enemy is the entire Republican Party and all of its voters, roughly half the country.",right
